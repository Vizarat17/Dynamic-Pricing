The Dynamic Pricing Model Web Application is an interactive tool designed to simulate and predict ride prices using machine learning. Built with Streamlit, this web app allows users to input key ride variables and receive real-time price estimates generated by a trained Random Forest Regressor model. The primary goal of this project is to showcase how dynamic pricing strategies, commonly used in ride-sharing platforms like Uber or Lyft, can be modeled using historical data and machine learning techniques.
Dynamic pricing is a technique where prices are adjusted based on fluctuating demand and supply conditions. This app mimics that approach by taking into account parameters such as the number of riders, number of drivers, vehicle type, and expected ride duration. By analyzing these inputs, the application can predict ride costs with high accuracy. The model behind the scenes is trained on a dataset containing ride details, making it capable of capturing real-world patterns in pricing behavior.
In addition to predicting prices, the app offers valuable visual feedback. Using Plotly graphs, users can see how the predicted prices align with actual historical values, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the model’s performance. The app also includes data visualizations that highlight profit and loss zones across different pricing scenarios, helping users understand when rides are financially beneficial or not.
From a technical standpoint, this project integrates tools such as Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, Scikit-learn for model training, and Plotly for visualization. The system is capable of handling missing values, ensuring smooth performance even when the input data is incomplete or noisy. The core logic resides in a single Python script (app.py), which runs as a Streamlit app and handles both data processing and the user interface.
Overall, this project serves as a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to tackle pricing challenges in real-time applications. It combines prediction, interactivity, and visualization in a compact and user-friendly format, making it a solid base for further experimentation or development. Future enhancements may include adding surge pricing factors, integrating location-based pricing, or deploying the app for public access using cloud services.
